# Chat_Service
## Simple and practical backend project

### Creation of a WebSocket server that creates a real time chat.

The server will ask for your username and then you can start chatting, the server is able to keep conversations for multiple users at the same time. You can try it on your own using incognito mode or using two devices like computer + mobile phone.
